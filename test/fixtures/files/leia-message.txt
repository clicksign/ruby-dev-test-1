General Kenobi. Years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in
his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father’s request to you
in person, but my ship has fallen under attack, and I’m afraid my mission to bring you to
Alderaan has failed.

I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of
this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to
him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
