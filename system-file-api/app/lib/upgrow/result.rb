  # Results are special Structs that are generated dynamically to accommodate a
  # set of pre-defined members. Since different Actions might want to return
  # zero to multiple values, they are always returned as members of a Result
  # instance.
  #
  # Regardless of the values the Action might want to return, a Result has one
  # default member called errors, which holds any errors that might occur when
  # the Action is performed. If Result errors are empty, the Result is a
  # success; if there are errors present, however, the Result is a failure. This
  # empowers Actions with a predictable public interface, so callers can expect
  # how to evaluate if an operation was successful or not by simply checking the
  # success or failure of a Result.
  #
  # Additionally, Result instances behave like monadic values by offering
  # bindings to be called only in case of success or failure, which further
  # simplifies the callerâ€™s code by not having to use conditional to check for
  # errors.
